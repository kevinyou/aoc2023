# aoc2023
These are my Rust solutions for 2023 Advent of Code

I've only started learning Rust about 2 weeks ago, so these solutions are not that great!

## Day 4
```
real    0m0.934s
user    0m0.934s
sys     0m0.000s
```

## Day 6
Brute force
```
kevinyou@worldship ~/projects/aoc2023 (main) $ time ./target/release/day6
real    0m0.074s
user    0m0.074s
sys     0m0.000s
```
